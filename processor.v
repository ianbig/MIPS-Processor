/**
 * READ THIS DESCRIPTION!
 *
 * The processor takes in several inputs from a skeleton file.
 *
 * Inputs
 * clock: this is the clock for your processor at 50 MHz
 * reset: we should be able to assert a reset to start your pc from 0 (sync or
 * async is fine)
 *
 * Imem: input data from imem
 * Dmem: input data from dmem
 * Regfile: input data from regfile
 *
 * Outputs
 * Imem: output control signals to interface with imem
 * Dmem: output control signals and data to interface with dmem
 * Regfile: output control signals and data to interface with regfile
 *
 * Notes
 *
 * Ultimately, your processor will be tested by subsituting a master skeleton, imem, dmem, so the
 * testbench can see which controls signal you active when. Therefore, there needs to be a way to
 * "inject" imem, dmem, and regfile interfaces from some external controller module. The skeleton
 * file acts as a small wrapper around your processor for this purpose.
 *
 * You will need to figure out how to instantiate two memory elements, called
 * "syncram," in Quartus: one for imem and one for dmem. Each should take in a
 * 12-bit address and allow for storing a 32-bit value at each address. Each
 * should have a single clock.
 *
 * Each memory element should have a corresponding .mif file that initializes
 * the memory element to certain value on start up. These should be named
 * imem.mif and dmem.mif respectively.
 *
 * Importantly, these .mif files should be placed at the top level, i.e. there
 * should be an imem.mif and a dmem.mif at the same level as process.v. You
 * should figure out how to point your generated imem.v and dmem.v files at
 * these MIF files.
 *
 * imem
 * Inputs:  12-bit address, 1-bit clock enable, and a clock
 * Outputs: 32-bit instruction
 *
 * dmem
 * Inputs:  12-bit address, 1-bit clock, 32-bit data, 1-bit write enable
 * Outputs: 32-bit data at the given address
